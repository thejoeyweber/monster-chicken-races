- we should use simple/vanilla technology where ever possible
- we should aim to keep the codebase lean
- we are "vibe coding" so I welcome your questions, ideas, and expansion on what we're building
- if you're ever unclear on anything or if you run into repeated errors, always stop, summarize the issue, and let us work through it together first before you continue working
- we're on windows and using PowerShell. whenever you use the terminal, default to PowerShell
- we use Python's built-in HTTP server (port 8000) for development: `python -m http.server`
